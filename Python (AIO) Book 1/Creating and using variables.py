"""
Rules for variable names:

>> The variable name must start with a letter or an underscore (_)
>> After the first character, you can use letters, numbers, or underscores
>> Variable names are case sensitive, so after you make up the name, any reference to that variable must use the same
   upper case and lowercase letters
>> Variable names cannot be enclosed in, or contain, single or double quotation marks
>> PEP 8 style conventions recommend that you use only lowercase letters in variable names and use an underscore to
   separate multiple words
   
   
Camel case formatting - whereby the first letter is lowercase and new words are capitalized e.g. extendedPrice, unitPrice

PEP 8 style formatting - extended_price, unit_price
"""

"""
To create a variable, you use the following syntax (order of things):

variablename = value

variablename can also be either x or y

Generally, it is a good idea to give variables names that make sense and are easy to remember based on the context
of the problem you are working on
